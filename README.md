# Rice-Fading-Matlab
The Rician fading model implemented in Matlab

Run main.m to start the GUI.

Entering values for the Rician K factor, the root mean sqaure of the signal (\hat{r}^2), and \phi the phase paramter.

The theoretical evenlope PDF and phase PDFs are plotted to compare with the simulation.
