# Rice-Fading-Matlab
The Rician fading model implemented in Matlab

Run main.m to start the GUI if Matlab is already installed.
Alternatively if Matlab isn't installed, can run the installer from the standalone app folder, which requires an internet connection to downlaod the required files.

Entering values for the Rician K factor, the root mean sqaure of the signal (\hat{r}^2), and \phi the phase paramter.

The theoretical evenlope PDF and phase PDFs are plotted to compare with the simulation and gives the execution time for the theoretical calculations and simulations together.
